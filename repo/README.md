## 3. Problems
I did not have that many issues when it comes to creating this project, the hardest was the planning out for different features. The hardest feature to implement was the popup for the converter page. I misread the instructions, and thought you actually had to make a popup, but from the image it was actually just a separate page, which would've made things much easier. However after some searching up around, and tinkering with my popup, I managed to make it work, and now when you click on Operations in the Converter Page, a Popup pops up, showing all the user information. For all things account storing and using their data, I also had to think up of what to use, and after noticing that I was accessing the file too many times from many places, I just globalised both current user that is using the converter, and the class that is accessing the document and modifying it when needed.

The funniest error I had was when I was updating the operations total count, and when I did that previously, it also replaced a number in the password, so I changed both password a little and the counter, which did confuse me for a bit.

However, overall, this project out of all was one that required the most time investment compared to any other project I've done in University so far.

## 4. Conclusions
This project aimed for us to advance our skills in the usage of Maui and understanding its connection with the C# language. 

It aimed at helping us figure out how to organize an application by classes, but also the development of soft skills like self learning and applying existing knowledge to a new problem or puzzle (as I call any programming task).

Unlike the guided works, or any other project for that matter, we only had what the assignment wanted from us, which is why this also allowed us to learn the capability to think critically and evaluate possible issues such as unexpected input from the user, or organization of code.

For me, this helped me overall increase my skill when it comes to finding the right knowledge and applying said knowledge in my work, while providing the best possible work from me.
